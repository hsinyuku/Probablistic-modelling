% Problematic Chain 1


% Spain comparing 2;500 and 4;800

% Why the Gender model performed worse (ex: % unconverged Rho in gender model , higher CrI)
 % A: It has many assumptions, ex: use latest gender distribution for earlier data period. The distribution data is for the whole Germany, but the daily data is state-level. 
 % B: less fine grained with only two groups
 
% Why simulated CFR and reported CFR doesn't fit in Age model
    % CFR in the gender model might have labelling problem. 
    % Abnormality in Hubei Age CFRs

% Limitation 
    % POLYMOD is 2005. (Is that an actual limitation though?)
    % Attempts to convert to discrete-Time System with Euler Forward integration (unsuccessfully)

% Bavaria - Consequences of having too many assumptions for the data
